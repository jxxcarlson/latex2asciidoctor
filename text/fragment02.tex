Now imagine your friend who lives down the street is also viewing a map of your neighborhood,
centered at his house. Your friend's screen doesn't look exactly the same as yours, but there
is a portion of your neighborhood which is both on yours and your friend's screen.
You may naturally construct a function
$$
\hspace{-1cm}
T:\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\text{the common portion of your}\\
\text{neighborhood on your screen}
\end{array}
\right) \to \left(
\begin{array}{c}
\text{the common portion on your}\\
\text{friend's screen}
\end{array}
\right),
$$
which identifies the points on the two screens that correspond to the same physical location.
This is an example of a transition function.
